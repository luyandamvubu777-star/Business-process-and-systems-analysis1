# Business Process & Systems Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyse real-world organisational
processes, identify inefficiencies, and propose structured, technology-enabled
solutions.

The focus is on documentation, systems thinking, and practical problem-solving.

## Problem Statement
Many organisations rely on informal processes that result in delays,
duplication of work, poor accountability, and loss of information.

## Approach
- Identified the existing ("as-is") process
- Documented workflow steps and decision points
- Highlighted inefficiencies and risks
- Proposed an improved ("to-be") system-supported process

## Example Use Case
Internal IT support request process.

## Tools & Methods

- Basic systems logic
- Business analysis principles

## Skills Demonstrated
